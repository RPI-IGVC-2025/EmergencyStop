# EStopRemoteV2

## DISCLAIMER!

This program is NOT intended for life-critical or industrial safety applications. This is meant for a college robotics team.

## Description

EStopRemoteV2 is the second iteration of a lightweight Emergency Stop protocol for RPI's IGVC Emergency Stop. All code has been refactored to be more readable and structured in a set hierarchy. It uses FreeRTOS as a way to multiprocess and leave CPU overhead for important tasks such as sending Emergency Stop packets. This protocol ensures the Emergency Stop works as intended and as fast as possible.
